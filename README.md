A place for my personal Macintosh development environment setup scripts

![program-main-menu-screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hiccup246/development-env/main/program-main-menu-screenshot.webp)


This repository contains various scripts written in `zsh` shell that configures a mac based development environment. The various scripts and configuration options are listed at the end of this readme in a [index](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration-index).

<br>

# üïπÔ∏è Usage
To run the installation scripts you must:

0. Setup ssh key if you have none
  - Generate a SSH key using the command 
     ```zsh
     ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -C <git_user_email> -f <ssh_file_name>
     ```
  - Copy the SSH key to your clipboard using the command below and add it to [Github](https://github.com/)
     ```zsh
     pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub
     ```
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `sudo chmod -R +x development-env` to make all project files executable
3. Navigate to the root directory. From here you can run any of the project scripts
  
The scripts can be run in any order but I would recommend executing them in the following order (Note that no 'main' script exists due to the execution times of some scripts):

0. `./info.sh` - Prints all possible commands
1. `./mac-setup.sh` - Configures MacOS
2. `./homebrew-setup.sh` - Installs homebrew packages and casks (GUI applications)
3. `./bash-setup.sh` - Adds homebrew bash (as opposed to system bash) to the list of viable shells
4. `./zsh-setup.sh` - Configures zsh terminal
5. `./appstore-setup.sh` - Installs appstore applications
6. `./git-setup.sh` - Configures Git global username and email
7. `./asdf-setup.sh` - Installs all programming languages
8. `./rustup-setup.sh` - Installs rust tooling
9. `./vscode-setup.sh` - Configures vscode for development
10. `./ssh-setup.sh` - Sets up ssh configuration
11. `./github-setup.sh` - Clone all public repos from a GitHub user

# ‚úçÔ∏è Manual Configuration
Unfortunately, some configuration cannot be done automatically or is more effective when done manually. The following configuration should be done manually:

## iTerm
* Profiles
  * Default
      * General -> Working Directory -> Reuse previous session's directory
      * Colors -> Color Presets -> Solarized Dark
      * Colors -> ANSI Colors -> Black bright to 40% grey
      * Text -> Font -> Space Mono for Powerline
          * You can download powerline fonts [here](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).
      * Keys -> Key Mappings -> Presets -> Natural Text Editing
          * This allows me to use the [keyboard shortcuts](https://gist.github.com/w3cj/022081eda22081b82c52)

## VSCode
Open VSCode and search for VSCode's `settings.json` file. Copy the content from `vscode-config.json` into the `settings.json`. You should see your editor instantly update.

## Alt tab
* Preferences
   * Appearance 
      * Hide Space number labels -> True
      * Hide status icons -> True

## General
- Update Flycut to save a larger clipboard history
- Install Chrome extensions
   - Bitwarden
   - Wappalyzer
   - AdBlock
   - ColorPick Eyedropper or Ultimate Color Picker

## Flycut
* Preferences
   * Clippings -> Remember -> 40

## MacOS
* System Settings
   * Desktop & Dock
      * Widgets -> Default web browser -> Google Chrome
   * General
      * Login Items
         * Open At Login
            * Add -> AltTab
            * Add -> Raycast
            * Add ->Flycut
   * Control centre
      * Menu Bar Only -> Spotlight -> Don't Show in Menu Bar
      * Automatically hide and show the menu bar -> Never
      * Control Centre Modules -> Bluetooth -> Show in Menu Bar

# üîß Troubleshooting
If a script fails to run first try re-running it, if it continues to fail then you will have to investigate why. The most common failure occurs in the `.zsh-setup` script where the powerline fonts and `.zshrc` file fail to configure correctly. To fix this one can try the following 
- Re-run the script
- Manually set the system `.zshrc` file using the command `cp .zshrc ~/` from within the root of the project directory

# üë∑ Development
To perform development on this project you must:
1. Clone this project
2. Grant executable permissions to the root directory with `sudo chmod -R +x development-env`
3. Install [`shfmt`](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) shell formatter by running the following command from [webinstall](https://webinstall.dev/shfmt/)
   ```zsh
   curl -sS https://webi.sh/shfmt | sh
   ```
4. Run the info script or refer to this documentation for available commands
   ```zsh
   ./info.sh
   ```
5. Format scripts after changes by running
   ```zsh
   shfmt -l -w .
   ```
