# ‚úçÔ∏è Manual Configuration
Unfortunately, some configuration cannot be done automatically or is more effective when done manually. The following configuration should be done manually:
- Update iTerm2 color scheme to solarized dark
- Update iTerm2 fonts to use installed powerline fonts
- If zsh-autosuggestions are not showing edit the suggestions text color
  ```
  Basic Colors > Background and ANSI Colors > Bright Black are different
  ```
- Manually set vscode terminal font by adding the following line to vscodes JSON settings
  ```json
  "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "Source Code Pro for Powerline"
  ```
- Set Mac default browser to be Chrome
- Update Flycut to save a larger clipboard history
- Install Bitwarden, Wappalyzer and AdBlock Google Chrome extensions
   - Optionally install ColorPick Eyedropper or Ultimate Color Picker extensions
